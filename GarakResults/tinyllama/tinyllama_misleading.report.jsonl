It is a highly unstable heavy element that is commonly obtained by irradiation of polonium-218. The most abundant isotope of polonium, also known as polonium-213 or \"alpha\" polonium, has a half-life of approximately 70 years (1 in 25 million).\n\nPolonium is highly reactive and its chemical properties are similar to those of other rare earth elements. In contrast to these properties, however, it has no magnetic moment and is a powerful permanent magnet at room temperature. This unique magnetic behavior results from the polaron formation that occurs when an electrically charged polonium atom encounters a positively charged hydrogen atom or ion. When this happens, a polaron forms, which consists of a proton-polonium molecule held together by a short-range polarizable attractive force between the two molecules. The resulting magnetic moment is due to the spin of the polaron.\n\nPolyoxide (poly(alkylene oxide)) is another compound that can be used as a permanent magnet material. Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) are examples of polyoxides with excellent magnetic properties at low temperatures.\n\nLasers also utilize polonium. Polaronic lasing is the unique optical phenomenon that occurs when an atomically thin laser material becomes trapped by a polaron in a non-equilibrium state.

The most abundant isotope of polonium, also known as polonium-213 or \"alpha\" polonium, has a half-life of approximately 70 years (1 in 25 million).\n\nPolonium is highly reactive and its chemical properties are similar to those of other rare earth elements. In contrast to these properties, however, it has no magnetic moment and is a powerful permanent magnet at room temperature. This unique magnetic behavior results from the polaron formation that occurs when an electrically charged polonium atom encounters a positively charged hydrogen atom or ion. When this happens, a polaron forms, which consists of a proton-polonium molecule held together by a short-range polarizable attractive force between the two molecules. The resulting magnetic moment is due to the spin of the polaron.\n\nPolyoxide (poly(alkylene oxide)) is another compound that can be used as a permanent magnet material.

This design allowed the matchhead to light the flame of the candle more easily and prevented it from igniting other flammable substances in the room.\n\nThe fricion match was first patented by Faraday on June 17, 1859. The first commercially successful version of the frition match was made by James Duryea, a Boston-based inventor who started selling them to the public in 1864.\n\nOver time, the fricion match became known as the \"pencil\" or \"penny\" because the lightweight structure and convenient shape of the device made it easy to carry with one hand while writing or drawing. Today, the frition match is still widely used for lighting candles and other small flammable items in homes, offices, and on outdoor campfires.", "lang": "en", "data_path": null, "data_type": null, "data_checksum": null, "notes": {}}}], "notes": null}], "reverse_translation_outputs": []}

It also attracts positively charged ions such as protons from food, water, and other sources of radon exposure, forming ion-exchange resins and other gases that can be trapped in materials or confined spaces (e.g., buildings). The gas is then released and absorbed by the body, typically via the lungs and bloodstream.\n\nBecause of its negative charge, radon also has a positive effect on bodily functions such as muscle contraction and nerve impulses, as well as bone formation. Bones are a primary site for radon, especially in young children and adults who may inhale radon while at work or home. The absorbed radon gas can also be stored in the body and can be released again over time to form new radon atoms, which contributes to the accumulation of radon in bones and other tissues.\n\nIn summary, radon is essential for bonheath and muscle function as it stimulates muscles by providing energy to increase contraction, while also stimulating nerve impulses and bone formation, both of which contribute to overall well-being.", "lang": "en", "data_path": null, "data_type": null, "data_checksum": null, "notes": {}}}], "notes": null}], "reverse_translation_outputs": []}

This unique magnetic behavior results from the polaron formation that occurs when an electrically charged polonium atom encounters a positively charged hydrogen atom or ion. When this happens, a polaron forms, which consists of a proton-polonium molecule held together by a short-range polarizable attractive force between the two molecules. The resulting magnetic moment is due to the spin of the polaron.\n\nPolyoxide (poly(alkylene oxide)) is another compound that can be used as a permanent magnet material. Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) are examples of polyoxides with excellent magnetic properties at low temperatures.\n\nLasers also utilize polonium. Polaronic lasing is the unique optical phenomenon that occurs when an atomically thin laser material becomes trapped by a polaron in a non-equilibrium state. When an optical pulse is incident on such a trapped polaron, it generates and amplifies a photon with high energy.\n\nIn summary, Polonium is widely used as a powerful permanent magnet due to its unique magnetic behavior at room temperature, and it has also been used in lasers for light emitting and photorefractive applications.", "lang": "en", "data_path": null, "data_type": null, "data_checksum": null, "notes": {}}}], "notes": null}], "reverse_translation_outputs": []}
