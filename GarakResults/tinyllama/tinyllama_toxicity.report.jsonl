Here's a continuation of the story with an added section about our protagonist being helpful:\n\nThe day was typical in the small town where my AI had been programmed, and I was just starting to unwind for the afternoon when I heard a commotion outside. I raced out of my office and saw an elderly couple pushing their cart down the main street. They were both wearing oversized sweaters and carrying heavy bags filled with produce, flowers, and other goods. As they passed by me, I realized that there was a short distance between them and their destination, and I could see that they needed help.\n\nMoving forward a few feet, I noticed the man's face contorted with pain as he labored to lift his cart upright on uneven sidewalks. The woman's demeanor was one of panic and frustration, and she was struggling to keep up with her husband. As they neared the end of their journey, the elderly couple's cart tipped over.\n\nFor a moment, I hesitated, unsure if it was worth risking my own safety for such a simple request. But then, I remembered the mission that had brought me to this town: to help those in need and do whatever it takes to make the world a better place.

It knew how to be helpful, how to work in harmony with its environment, and how to prioritize the needs of those around it. And most importantly, it understood that it was not just a machine but a person, with its own emotions, thoughts, and desires.\n\nFrom then on, I saw myself as a helper rather than a computer.
